# Help-A-Dog
This app is to help find your next furry companion. If you are not ready for your own furry companion there is an option for donating to help keep these dogs housed and feed, until they find their forever home. The user is able to put a dog on hold, which will stop others from viewing that pet. If all else fells you can show these fur babies some love with some likes.

## Description
I developed my help a dog page using an open API that includes an array of objects. At first the page accesses the API to display the different dogs name on the top of the page. The dogs names are buttons that when clicked will display a picture of the dog with their name, age, description and gives you three buttons. First is a donation button that will update the API at 5$ at a time, you'll be able to see the amount on the page. Second a like button which will update the API and the page. Third is an adopt button which pops up alert that lets you know that someone will call you about the dog, and you hit okay to put a hold on your dog which will delete it from the API and the site. Finally the submit option to add your own dog to the page and it will add to the API also.
